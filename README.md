## Assignment Challenge
In this assignment, we practiced 'scrapping' though creating a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. This chanllenge utilzed Mongoose, Mongo, Cheerio, Express, Handlebars, etc muscles to scrape news from another site and set up a solid full stack appilcation.

## Technical Approach
- The challenge of this assignment was really using Handlebars: which I am still a bit fuzzy on as we have used it only through node/express and not on the front-end as it seems to be mainly utilitzed. I tired to impliment some of the GET/POST requests via html-5 form submit, but ended back tracking to ajax due to increased utility of the callbacks.
